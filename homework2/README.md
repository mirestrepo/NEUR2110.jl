# Homework 2: Periodogram, Spectograms and Fourier Transfom

The homework is stated in the accompaning PDF. The solution to each (requiered) problem is given in a separate jupyter notebook, named accordingly.

The plots require javascript rendering, which GitHub does not allow. Therefore for proper rendering of the solutions, please referred to the [nbviewer version of this folder](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mirestrepo/NEUR2110.jl/blob/master/homework4):

* [Problem 1](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mirestrepo/NEUR2110.jl/blob/master/homework2/Problem1.ipynb): Spectrograms based on periodogram (rectangular window), Hann taper and multitaper.
* [Problem 2](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mirestrepo/NEUR2110.jl/blob/master/homework2/Problem2.ipynb): Fourier Transform of a Gaussian
* [Problem 3](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mirestrepo/NEUR2110.jl/blob/master/homework2/Problem3.ipynb): Rectangular window, zero padding and frequency resolution.
* [Problem 4](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mirestrepo/NEUR2110.jl/blob/master/homework2/Problem4.ipynb): Multitaper single trial confidence intervals.
