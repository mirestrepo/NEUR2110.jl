# Homework 1: Stationary Processes, AR(n), Autocorrelation and Autocovariance

This homework consists of three main problems. The solution to each problem is given in a separate jupyter notebook, named accordingly.

The plots require javascript rendering, which GitHub does not allow. Therefore for proper rendering of the solutions, please referred to the [nbviewer version](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mirestrepo/NEUR2110.jl/blob/master/homework1):

* [Problem 1](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mirestrepo/NEUR2110.jl/blob/master/homework1/Problem1.ipynb): Event Related Phenomena (ERP),  mean, variance and bootstrap confidence intervals
* [Problem 2](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mirestrepo/NEUR2110.jl/blob/master/homework1/Problem2.ipynb): Random Walk
* [Problem 3](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mirestrepo/NEUR2110.jl/blob/master/homework1/Problem3.ipynb): AR(6), companion matrix, autocovariance and autocorrelation functions
