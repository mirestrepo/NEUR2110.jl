# NEUR2110

Julia code used to solve homework problems in Statistical Neuroscience course (NEUR2110) at Brown University.

The course uses MATLAB and Python as primari languages and uses MATLAB warm-up code from https://github.com/Mark-Kramer/Case-Studies-Kramer-Eden. In this repository [we](https://github.com/paulstey/statistical_neuroscience) attempt to solve the problems using as much pure Julia as possible. We recogniza that Julia is still a young language and hope this matrial will highlight the sethenghs and areas of improvement when using Julia for statistical neuroscience.

Each homework is organized in tits corresponding folder. Common code is organized as a library

## Why Julia

As highlighted by [Julia Computing](https://juliacomputing.com):

"[Julia](https://julialang.org) is the fastest modern open-source language for data science, machine learning and scientific computing. Julia provides the functionality, ease-of-use and intuitive syntax of R, Python, Matlab, SAS or Stata combined with the speed, capacity and performance of C, C++ or Java."
